# Pathogen Contextual Data Specification
_UNDER DEVELOPMENT_

Metadata template for genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens for vaccine and AMR purposes

## Rationale
Contextual metadata is crucial for effective genomic surveillance in public health as it provides valuable information about the
samples being analyzed, and facilitates aggregation of data from multiple sources (routine surveillance, research projects) to
identify broader trends across time and geography. In the case of bacterial pathogens, there are templates available for surveillance
and outbreak investigation for foodborne pathogens (e.g. the One Health Enterics template), but no consensus on fields of importance
for genomic surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and vaccine antigens. 

Here we propose a common framework for contextual metadata for genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens for vaccine and AMR purposes.

This has been developed by members of various groups working on genomic surveillance to inform or monitor vaccine development and 
deployment in relation to a range of pathogens, including those with current vaccines (_Salmonella_ Typhi, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, Group B 
Streptococcus, pertussis, _Neisseria meningitidis_) and those in various stages of vaccine development (_Klebsiella_, Shigella, non-typhoidal
_Salmonella_, etc).

_THIS SPECIFICATION IS STILL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT_

## Approach
This framework incorporates fields proposed in the [PHA4GE Minimal Pathogen Agnostic Contextual Data Specification](https://github.com/pha4ge/minimal-pathogen-agnostic-contextual-data-specification) and [PHA4GE QC tags](https://github.com/pha4ge/contextual_data_QC_tags), and maps to [compulsory fields for INSDC submissions](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We also draw on the approach to _purpose of sampling_ taken by the [PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 Contextual Data Specification](https://github.com/pha4ge/SARS-CoV-2-Contextual-Data-Specification). As with the PHA4GE templates, wherever possible we use terms from the [GenEpiO ontology](https://genepio.org/).

This template is intended for dual use - to facilitate data collection and to enable data sharing. Strength of requirements will vary by use case (e.g. some fields are required for data collection but not for data sharing). Differential requirements are indicated by use case in the template. Users may filter based on intended use (data collection or data sharing). Care should be taken to ensure that metadata provided do not result in sharing of patient identifiable information. In addition, no metadata should be shared without relevant ethical approvals.
